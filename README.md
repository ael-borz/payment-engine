# Payment Engine

Application that reads a series of transactions
from a CSV, updates client accounts, handles disputes and chargebacks, and then outputs the
state of clients accounts as a CSV.

* `main.rs` - Entrypoint
* `io.rs` - CSV reader & writer
* `engine.rs` - Business logic

## Correctness
* There are 16 unit tests for the most obvious cases
* There is also a small sample data and a large one (generated by a Python script `sample_builder.py`)

## Safety and robustness
* The code is safe
* The code panics if deserializing fails and if writing to stdout fails
